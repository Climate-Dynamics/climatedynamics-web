.. admonition:: RainX: Downscaling and Prediction of Rainfall Extremes from Climate Model Outputs

   The PhD project RainX will leverage climate modelling and extreme value theory to predict rainfall extremes - one of the grand challenges in climate change impact prediction. The full project description can be found on the ExaGEO website `here <https://www.exageo.org/phd-student-projects/>`_.

.. admonition:: Additional PhD Opportunities

   There are several additional PhD opportunities offered in the doctoral training programme ExaGEO. Please consult the list of projects advertised on the ExaGEO website `here <https://www.exageo.org/phd-student-projects/>`_.

.. note::

   If you identified potential sources of funding and feel you would fit into the *"Climate Dynamics Lab"*, don't hesitate to get in touch - we may be able to support you in your application. Feel free to `contact us <\sebastian.mutz@glasgow.ac.uk>`_ also if you already have other sources of funding and would like to join us.


Enquiries about Supervision
---------------------------

Enquiries about supervision are always welcome, esp. if your research interests fall into one of the following categories:

- Climate dynamics and climate change (past, present and future)
- Climate change impacts (e.g., how climate change affects glaciers, erosion, extreme events or health)
- Climate - landscape dynamics
- Numerical modelling and model development
- Data analysis, statistics, machine learning and AI

Browsing the list of ongoing and completed research projects may give you a better idea of the type of work typically supervised. However, future projects can go beyond this scope. Feel free to make suggestions and show your passion and creativity!
