The School of Geographical and Earth Sciences (GES) at the University of Glasgow offers a number of undergraduate and postgraduate courses suitable for those interested in tackling the big scientific questions and problems related to environment and climate.

The following courses are currently being taught (partially or completely) by Sebastian G. Mutz:


Theoretical and Applied Climatology (EARTH5019)
-----------------------------------------------

The course provides an introduction to fundamental aspects of theoretical and applied climatology. It explores the theoretical foundations of climate science, such as celestial mechanics, first-order energy fluxes, heat and mass transport in the atmosphere, structural aspects of Earth's climate system, rain formation, and climate change of the past, present and future. This is complemented by an introduction to important principles in applied climatology, including statistics, probability theory, empirical analysis, and modern mathematical modelling. Finally, a hands-on exploration of fundamental coding practices, and the application of some of the above-mentioned principles, will prepare the students to work with climate datasets on contemporary climate-related problems in a modern research and industry work setting. You can find more details about the course `here <https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=EARTH5019/>`_.


Global Challenges (GEOG5120)
----------------------------

This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to global challenges, incorporating research-led teaching in geography and earth sciences. It is problem-led and uses interdisciplinary teaching teams to deliver case study examples of contemporary environmental and social issues. Environments and communities across the world are under stress in our changing climate, with new ecological, social and political vulnerabilities emerging in diverse spaces. Students will benefit from learning across the human and environmental sciences, gaining technical knowledge of geophysical and environmental processes underpinned by critical philosophies and ethics to enact meaningful change for healthier, more sustainable Earth futures.

Introduction to Climate Change and Sustainability (GEOG1015)
------------------------------------------------------------

An Interdisciplinary Introduction to Climate Change: A 10-week structured, accredited evening course centred around providing students with an interdisciplinary introduction to climate change, using approaches from both the social sciences (history, sociology, geography, politics, economics), and the natural sciences (engineering, physics, biology). The course will provide a brief look into historical and sociological causes of the climate crisis, followed by both the physical and human consequences. The course will have a strong focus on potential solutions, drawing on ideas from engineering and science (renewable technology), and politics, sociology, and economics (social change).  This will leave students with a positive, action-based knowledge base on the context of the climate crisis, and current theories on how to act. You can find more details about the course `here <https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=GEOG1015/>`_.


Geography 2 (GEOG2001)
----------------------

Level 2 Geography course providing an understanding of key principles and current issues in human, physical and environmental geographies. You can find more details about the course `here <https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=GEOG2001/>`_.
